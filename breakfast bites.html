    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Arrange 1 piece hash brown in center of each tortilla; then, dividing
      evenly,<br />
      top with bacon, eggs, and cheese. Tightly wrap tortilla around filling,
      pleating edges, then place pleated side down.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Heat 1 tsp oil in large nonstick skillet on medium. Place 2 wraps, pleated
      sides <br />down, in skillet and cook each, pressing down on wrap and
      standing sides up as <br />necessary, until entire tortilla is golden
      brown, about 2 minutes per large sides and 1 minute for smaller sides.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Repeat with remaining oil and wraps. Cut wraps in half and serve with hot
      sauce if <br />
      desired
